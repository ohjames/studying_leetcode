# Two Pointers Pattern

## Key Concepts
- Two pointers are used to traverse the data structure simultaneously.
- The pointers usually start at different positions or move at different speeds.
- The positions of the pointers can be manipulated to perform various operations.
- Common operations include searching, sorting, or finding a specific element.
- This pattern is useful for solving problems involving arrays, linked lists, or strings.

## Benefits
- Efficiency: The two pointers pattern can help optimize time and space complexity.
- Versatility: It can be applied to a wide range of problems involving different data structures.
- Simplicity: The pattern is relatively easy to understand and implement.
