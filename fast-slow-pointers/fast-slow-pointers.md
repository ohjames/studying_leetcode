## Fast & Slow Pointers Pattern

The fast and slow pointers pattern is a technique commonly used in solving problems related to linked lists or arrays. It involves using two pointers, one moving at a faster pace than the other.

Here's a breakdown of the fast and slow pointers pattern:

1. Initialize two pointers, usually called "fast" and "slow", pointing to the head of the linked list or the start of the array.

2. Move the fast pointer at a faster pace, typically by advancing it by two steps at a time, while the slow pointer moves one step at a time.

3. Continue moving the pointers until a certain condition is met. This condition could be reaching the end of the linked list or array, or finding a specific element.

4. Analyze the position of the slow pointer to determine the desired result. For example, it could be the middle element of the linked list, the nth element from the end, or the point of intersection in a cycle detection problem.

5. Use the information obtained from the slow pointer to solve the problem or perform the required operations.

The fast and slow pointers pattern is a powerful technique that can be used to optimize time and space complexity in various algorithms. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to track two different positions or find patterns within a data structure.

Remember to document your observations and insights while implementing the fast and slow pointers pattern in your code. This will help you understand the logic behind the solution and make it easier to explain or debug in the future.
### Example Implementation

Here's an example implementation of the fast and slow pointers pattern for finding two numbers that add up to a specific target in an array:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Initialize two pointers
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    
    # Traverse the array
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        
        if current_sum == target:
            return [nums[left], nums[right]]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return None
```

In this implementation, we start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the start and end of the array respectively. We then traverse the array by moving the pointers towards each other. If the sum of the numbers at the current positions equals the target, we return those numbers. If the sum is less than the target, we increment the `left` pointer to consider a larger number. If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement the `right` pointer to consider a smaller number. If we exhaust all possible pairs without finding a match, we return `None`.

This is just one example of how the fast and slow pointers pattern can be applied. Remember to adapt the implementation based on the specific problem you are solving.
